# commitment-device

I took a page from James Clear's Atomic Habits on a *commitment device*. The book mentions to kick a **bad habit** following inversion of the third law , we need to make it difficult. This git is  
- acknowledgement of a bad habit
- a commitment for myself so i can copy this host file and apply this to other devices that I am using

If you find it interesting, I hope this helps others as well
